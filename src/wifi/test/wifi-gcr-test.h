/**
 * @ingroup wifi-test
 * @ingroup tests
 *
 * @brief Base class for GCR tests
 *
 * It considers an AP and multiple STAs (with different capabilities) using either GCR-UR or GCR-BA.
 * The AP generates either multicast packets only or alternatively multicast and unicast packets.
 *
 * The test eventually corrupts some MPDUs based on a provided list of groupcast MPDUs in a given
 * PSDU (indices are starting from 1) that should not be successfully received by a given STA or by
 * all STA (s). It may also corrupts specific frames, such as RTS/CTS or action frames that are used
 * to establish or teardown Block Ack agreements. The latter is needed is needed for GCR-BA or for
 * GCR-UR when A-MPDU is used.
 *
 * It is checked that:
 *
 * - When no GCR-capable STA is present, GCR service is not used
 * - When the GCR service is used, groupcast frames are transmitted using HT, VHT or HE modulation
 * class, depending on the supported modulations by member STAs
 * - When the GCR is used, groupcast MPDUs carry an A-MSDU made of a single A-MSDU subframe,
 * regardless of the A-MSDU size settings
 * - When the GCR service is used, the expected protection mechanism is being used prior to the
 * transmission of the groupcast packet
 * - When the GCR service is used and RTS/CTS protection is selected, the receiver address of RTS
 * frames corresponds to the MAC address of one of the STA of the group
 * - When GCR-BA or GCR-UR with agreement is used, the expected amount of ADDBA request and response
 * frames has been received and they all contain the GCR group address
 * - when Block Ack agreement timeout is used, the expected amount of DELBA frames has been received
 * and they all contain the GCR group address
 * - The expected buffer size is being selected for the GCR Block Ack agreement, depending on what
 * is supported by each member
