 *
 * The mobility support includes:
 *  - a set of mobility models which are used to track and maintain
 *    the "current" cartesian position and speed of an object.
 *
 *  - a "course change notifier" trace source which can be used to register
 *    listeners to the course changes of a mobility model
 *
 *  - a number of helper classes which are used to place nodes and setup
 *    mobility models (including parsers for some mobility definition formats).
